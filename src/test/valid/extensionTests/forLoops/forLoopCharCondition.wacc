# Use a character as a loop condition. Enter the loop once only, then exit the loop.

# Output:
# Change c
# Should print "Change c" once before.

# Program:

begin
	char c = '\0' ;
	for(char a = c; a == '\0'; a = 'a') do
		println "Change c"
	done ;
	println "Should print \"Change c\" once before."
end
